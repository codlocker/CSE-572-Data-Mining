## HW - 3

#### TASK 1

Code + Answers are in the following notebook : [Code](https://github.com/codlocker/CSE-572-Data-Mining/blob/master/HW3-Task1.ipynb)

I have attached the Notebook as a PDF below, but Jupyter does not seem to do proper word wrapping for the PDF so kindly refer to the Github link for clarity.

For executing the code, here are the instructions.

- Install Python 3 and create a virtual environment [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- Install Jupyter notebook [Project Jupyter | Installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)
- Ensure the following packages are installed (or you can install jupyter, numpy, scikit, surprise and matplotlib directly using conda or pip)
  - scikit-image==0.19.2
  - scikit-learn==1.0.2
  - scikit-learn-intelex ==2021.6.0
  - pandas ==1.4.4
  - numpy==1.21.5
  - numpy-base==1.21.5
  - numpy==1.4.0
  - matplotlib==3.5.2
  - matplotlib-base==3.5.2
  - matplotlib-inline==0.1.6
- The Dataset should the located in this relative path : __datasets/kmeans_data/data.csv__ and __datasets/kmeans_data/label.csv__
